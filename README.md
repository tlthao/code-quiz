Objective:
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz <br>
WHEN I click the start button<br>
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question<br>
WHEN I answer a question<br>
THEN I am presented with another question<br>
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly<br>
THEN time is subtracted from the clock<br>
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0<br>
THEN the game is over<br>
WHEN the game is over<br>
THEN I can save my initials and my score<br>

Experience:<br>
This was an extremely hard assignment. I learned to use a lot of JQuery and there was a lot of trial and error to make my code work. Overall, I learned a lot about the logic for javascript.
