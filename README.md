<h2>Objective:</h2>
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz <br>
WHEN I click the start button<br>
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question<br>
WHEN I answer a question<br>
THEN I am presented with another question<br>
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly<br>
THEN time is subtracted from the clock<br>
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0<br>
THEN the game is over<br>
WHEN the game is over<br>
THEN I can save my initials and my score<br>

<h2>Experience:</h2>
This was an extremely hard assignment. It was extremely frustrating getting the game to work the way I want it to. I learned to use a lot of JQuery and there was a lot of trial and error to make my code work. Overall, the assignment helped me practice a lot of what I learned in class. There were certain things I wasn't sure about but after creating this game, it helped me understand a bit better.
